    <div id="d12-intro"><p><strong>D12 was a rap supergroup formed in Detroit, Michigan.</strong> They existed from 1996 until 2018, when former member Eminem declared it to be "broken up" in his song <em>Stepping Stones</em>.</p></div>

    <p id="d12-album-introducer"><span id="favorite-lyrics-header">Some of my favorite lines from D12 songs:</span><br>
    <em>"Light a cigarette, flick it at 'im, or spit it at 'im<br>
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him"<br></em><strong> - Kuniva, <em>Fight Music</strong></em><br><em>Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on<br>
But if I help you sell one record<br>
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked<br>
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends<br>
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them!<br></em><strong> - Eminem,<em> Girls</strong></em><br>
  <span id="one-shot-2-shot"><em>"Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling<br>
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing<br>
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying<br>
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled"<br></em>
<strong> - Kon Artis, <em>One Shot 2 Shot</em></strong></span>
<span id="underground"><em>"Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets<br>
And a strap that wraps twice around my back<br>
Then they latch it; cut your f***in' head off<br>
And ask where you're headed off to<br>
Get it? Headed off to?"<br></em><strong> - Eminem, <em>Underground</em></strong></span>
